	<h2><center>What are NBTs?</center></h2>

	<p>NBTs (National Benchmark Tests) are multiple-choice tests that assess a learner's academic literacy and mathematical skills, to measure their academic readiness for tertiary institutions. Many South African universities require a learner to write the NBT. This is because the NBTs are designed to supplement the NSC results, and to help institutions meet the needs of the upcoming learners as effectively as they can.</p>

	<h2 style="width: fit-content;"><center>Extra notes derived from Youtube videos:</center></h3>
	
	<h4>The night before writing the test</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>GET ENOUGH SLEEP! You'll be writing for 3 hours (or 6 hours if you chose to write MAT aswell). Not getting enough sleep will definitely affect your brain power and problem-solving skills.</li>
		</ul>
	<h4>AQL test</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Arrive at the venue atleast 30 minutes before the test starts. Most people advised to arrive at the venue by 7:30 AM</li>
			<li>The tests start around 8 AM (Might vary depending on the venue)</li>
			<br>
		</ul>
	<h4>MAT test</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Once the AQL test has finished, there'll  be a 45 minute(might vary) break! Use this time to calm down, replenish your hunger or thirst, and regain energy. Try not to do any strenous activities.</li>
			<li>A formulae sheet will be given! You don't need to memorize them (if you're able to, memorize them), but try to understand the formulae as best as you can before writing the test.</li>
		</ul>
</div>

<br>

<div id="MyExperience">
	<h2>My Experience:</h2>
	<p>It's been basically a year since I wrote the NBTs (1st July 2023).
		I wrote both AQL and MAT and passed both thankfully :D.
		The AQL test was easier than MAT for me. I also felt that writing AQL was
		easier since it was written in early morning, as opposed to the MAT test which was written not even
		an hour after we finished AQL.
	</p>
	<p>I felt that writing in the holidays between term 2 and term 3 was the best for me,
		since most of the content for both Math and English would've been covered.
		After writing both test, I felt that most of the questions were answerable and that
		there was no new content; just REALLY tricky questions (especially in the MAT test).
	</p>
	<p>BRING FOOD! The Cafetaria and food shops aren't guaranteed to be open depending
		on the day that you write. I wrote on a Saturday and didn't see any cafe's or shops open.
		As a result, I didnt have much energy and wasn't fully focused when writing MAT.
	</p>
	<!-- <p>The campus is also very empty and quiet (except for the other students writing with you).
		It won't be as fun as the open-day (if you went to it). But it'll still be nice to
		browse around if you want to.
